# Radix Sort Algorithm
This repository contains a Java implementation of the Radix Sort algorithm. Radix Sort is an efficient, non-comparative sorting algorithm that sorts integers by processing individual digits. This implementation uses Counting Sort as the intermediate stable sorting algorithm, and works on positive integers of base 10.

It has a Big-O Time Complexity of $O(d\cdot n)$, where $d$ represents the number of digits of the largest integer in the input array and $n$ the size of the input array.
